summary: "How are populations structured in space? How does this structure affect adaptation?"
---

Most natural populations are spread out in space, so that families from different parts of the range
may go many generations without ever coming near each other. 
How can we use genetics to [infer](/research/inference.html) the importance of spatial structure to population dynamics? 
How does this spatial structure interact with adaptive evolution?
