Tyler is a PhD candidate in the Physics Graduate Program at Emory, and is interested in the relation between dispersal and isolation by distance in spatially structured populations.  His current research efforts involve extending classical population genetics models to include the effects of long range dispersal, and developing inference schemes based on these generalized models that estimate the dispersal dynamics of animal and microbial populations from genetic data.  

Outside of research, Tyler enjoys doing improv comedy, playing poker, and hanging out with his cats.
