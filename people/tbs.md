Tyler is a fifth year PhD candidate in the Physics Graduate Program at Emory, where he works with professor Daniel Weissman on developing mathematical models of how the movement of individuals through space affects the genetic diversity of entire populations.  In addition to developing new models, Tyler is interested in applying these models to genetic data in order to estimate the dispersal and demographic properties of real populations.  Outside of research, Tyler enjoys doing improv comedy, playing poker, and hanging out with his cats.
