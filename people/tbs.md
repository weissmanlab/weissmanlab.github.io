Tyler is a sixth-year PhD candidate in the Physics Graduate Program at Emory, where he works with professor Daniel Weissman on modeling dispersal and isolation by distance in spatially structured populations.  In addition to developing new models, Tyler is interested in using these models to estimate dispersal rates from genetic data.  Outside of research, Tyler enjoys doing improv comedy, playing poker, and hanging out with his cats.
