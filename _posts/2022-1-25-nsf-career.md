Daniel has received an NSF CAREER award for ``Quantifying adaptation and recombination in pathogen populations''. This 5-year grant will provide funding for us to study how to infer the fitness landscape and transmission patterns underlying the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, and to quantify patterns of gene exchange in the bacterium *Staphylococcus aureus* using our collaborator Tim Read's [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu/) database. It will also fund a new science club that we will start at the [Global Village Project](https://globalvillageproject.org/), a middle school serving refugee girls from around the world. If you're interested in collaborating on any of these projects, please let us know!
