Congratulations to Tyler Smith on defending his PhD thesis! Tyler will be taking his expertise on long-range dispersal and joining Boeing's research department in August. Tyler defended over Zoom, but for the post-defense celebration we got together for our first in-person lab event since the pandemic!
