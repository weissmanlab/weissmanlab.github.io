Postdoc positions are potentially available, including [Fellowships in the Theory and Modeling of Living Systems](http://livingtheory.emory.edu/people/post-docs.html). Please contact Daniel if interested.

Prospective graduate students: please apply to the graduate programs in [Physics](http://www.physics.emory.edu/home/grad/index.html)
or [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) (PBEE).
Students interested in applying to PBEE should also contact Daniel before applying if possible; for Physics this is unnecessary.

Undergraduates: please contact Daniel directly. Ordinarily, undergraduates joining the group should have some familiarity with programming and should start no later than the beginning of their junior year. Earlier is better---making a real scientific discovery takes time!

We all strive to treat each other with kindness and respect, and help each other in studying the natural world. We believe in the importance of equity and inclusion in our group and in our community.
